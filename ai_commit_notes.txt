## 🔄 DETAILED FILE MOVEMENTS AND TRANSFORMATIONS

### 📋 ROOT LEVEL ORGANIZATION
- **readme.txt → README.md**: Transformed plain text to professional Markdown with badges, emojis, and comprehensive structure
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: NEW file created with gold standard contribution guidelines
- **All scattered root files**: Organized into proper directory structure

### 📂 VBA CODE REORGANIZATION
**Core Shared Modules (NEW CONCEPT):**
- `src/ryan_workbook/modArchival.bas` → `src/vba/core/modArchival.bas`
- `src/ryan_workbook/modFormatting.bas` → `src/vba/core/modFormatting.bas`
- `src/ryan_workbook/modUtilities.bas` → `src/vba/core/modUtilities.bas`
- `src/ryan_workbook/modPerformanceDashboard.bas` → `src/vba/core/modPerformanceDashboard.bas`

**Workbook-Specific Organization:**
- `src/ally_workbook/*` → `src/vba/workbooks/ally/`
  - Module_Dashboard.bas, Module_Identity.bas, Sheet12 (SQRCT Dashboard).cls
- `src/master_workbook/*` → `src/vba/workbooks/master/`
  - Module1.bas, Sheet2 (SQRCT Dashboard).cls
- `src/ryan_workbook/*` → `src/vba/workbooks/ryan/`
  - All VBA modules and classes moved with proper organization
- `src/ryan_workbook - Copy/*` → `src/vba/workbooks/ryan/backup/`
  - Historical backup files properly archived
- `src/sync_tool/*` → `src/vba/workbooks/sync_tool/`
  - All SyncTool VBA modules moved to dedicated directory

### 📊 POWER QUERY CODE
