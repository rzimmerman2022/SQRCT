# SQRCT Update - April 20, 2025

**Last Updated:** 2025-04-20  
**Version:** Post-v4.0.0 WIP  
**Type:** Phase Logic Verification, Bug Fixes

## Summary
Project: SQRCT Dashboard
Version Target: Post-v4.0.0 WIP (Phase Logic Verification Post-Revert)

Context:
Following debugging challenges with UI consistency and counts, code state was reverted to align more closely with the Apr 18 baseline commit (targeting functional Engagement Phase logic) to establish a stable verification point.

Changes Verified/Implemented in this Update:

1.  Verified: Engagement Phase Handling (ThisWorkbook, modUtilities)
    * Confirmed the Data Validation dropdown list for Engagement Phase (Column L on Dashboard, Column B on UserEdits) is correctly applied based on the `PHASE_LIST` named range.
    * Confirmed the `Workbook_SheetChange` event handler successfully utilizes the `modUtilities.GetPhaseFromPrefix` helper function (which was re-added) to:
        * Auto-complete unique phase prefixes typed by the user.
        * Auto-correct phase text to match the case in `PHASE_LIST`.
        * Reject invalid or ambiguous phase entries with a user alert.
        * Display the specific informational pop-up message when "Other (Active)" or "Other (Archive)" is selected/completed.
        * Attempt to move cursor to the Comments column (N) after selecting an "Other" phase.

2.  Fix: Restored Missing Helper Function
    * Re-added the `GetPhaseFromPrefix` function definition to the `modUtilities` module, resolving compile errors related to phase handling.

Current State (After this commit):
* The core logic for user interaction with the Engagement Phase dropdown and text entry is confirmed functional based on the reverted code state.
* UI inconsistencies (Row 2 backgrounds, count display/styling, timestamp location) and placeholder counts ("TBC") from the Apr 18 baseline likely still exist in this version. These require re-application of fixes identified during later troubleshooting.

Next Steps:
* Carefully re-implement fixes for UI consistency and dynamic counts based on the final agreed-upon strategy (e.g., final "o3 patch" logic from previous discussions, resulting in code similar to Response #55).
* Verify overall data filtering logic based on `ARCHIVE_PHASES` constant (if that was the final decision before reverting).
